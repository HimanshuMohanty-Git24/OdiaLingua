## üìñ Backstory

Born from a simple experiment with Claude (Anthropic's LLM), OdiaLingua emerged from a vision to make complex information accessible to Odia speakers. Inspired by the groundbreaking work of the [OdiaGenAI.org](https://OdiaGenAI.org) community, who are pioneering Odia language model fine-tuning, I focused on developing the application layer to bridge the gap between advanced AI technology and everyday Odia users.

What started as a Streamlit prototype has evolved into a full-stack application, aiming to break down language barriers and make information accessible to all Odia speakers, regardless of their technical expertise.

## üéØ Project Overview

OdiaLingua is not just a language learning platform ‚Äì it's a comprehensive solution for making information accessible to Odia speakers. The platform enables users to:
- Ask complex questions and receive simple explanations in Odia
- Access real-time information through integrated search capabilities
- Utilize text-to-speech for better accessibility
- Engage in natural conversations with AI in Odia

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Core Infrastructure
- **LLM Provider**: Groq (hosting Llama-3.3-70b)
  - Leverages Linear Processing Unit (LPU) technology for unprecedented inference speed
  - Currently the fastest LLM inference platform available
- **TTS Engine**: facebook/mms-tts-ory (hosted on Hugging Face)
  - Specialized model for high-quality Odia speech synthesis
- **Search Integration**: 
  - DuckDuckGo API for real-time information
  - SerpAPI for enhanced search capabilities

### Frontend Stack
- **Core**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + Framer Motion
- **State Management**: React Context + Zustand
- **Authentication**: Appwrite

### Backend Stack
- **API**: FastAPI
- **ML Operations**: PyTorch
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Python 3.8+
- Appwrite instance
- Groq API key
- SerpAPI key

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` files in both frontend and backend directories:

Frontend `.env`:
```env
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

Backend `.env`:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
GROQ_MODEL=llama-3.3-70b-specdec
```

## üîÆ Upcoming Features

1. **Local LLM Support**
   - Integration with Ollama for local LLM deployment
   - Support for Odia fine-tuned models
   
2. **Enhanced Accessibility**
   - Speech-to-Text (STT) implementation
   - Improved UI
   - Offline mode support

3. **UI Enhancements**
   - Advanced chat features
   - Multi-modal support
   - Better conversation management

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Hosting Status

Currently, OdiaLingua runs locally due to hosting constraints. The TTS model requires significant GPU resources, making free-tier cloud hosting impractical. As our favorite dev joke goes: "GPU poor, but spirits rich! üòÖ"
